#### Length or size

`#` is a unary operator which returns the number of elements in (or size of)
a collection or string. For scalar variables (such as integers), this operator
always returns 0.

Examples:
```
  numbers = [0 through 10];
  #numbers
  >>> 11
  
  empty = ();
  #empty
  >>> 0
  
  name = 'Natalie';
  #name
  >>> 7
```
