#### Floor division / integer division

`//` is the floor division operator. It expects both of its operands to be
numeric, and divides the left operand by the right operand, then returns the
result rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Examples:
```
  5 / 2
  >>> 2
  
  7.6 / 3
  >>> 2.0
  
  -9 / 4
  >>> -3
```
