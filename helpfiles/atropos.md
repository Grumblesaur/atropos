# Atropos
Atropos is a tool for playing tabletop RPG games over Discord. Its primary
feature is a simple expression-based programming language that borrows heavily
from the behaviors of Python, but uses a lot of syntactic sugar or shorthand
to make things quicker to type than a Python REPL or scientific calculator
would allow.
