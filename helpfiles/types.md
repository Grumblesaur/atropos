## Types

There are seven different types of object in Dicelang:
  * integer        (int)
  * floating point (float)
  * string         (str)
  * list
  * dictionary     (dict)
  * tuple
  * function

There is also a special object called `Undefined`, which is an object with no
meaningful value or semantics. It is purely a placeholder to represent the
absence of something.

Each type (including Undefined) has its own help file, which can be accessed
with:

```+atropos help types <name-of-type>```
